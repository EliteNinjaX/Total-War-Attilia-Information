- **Objective:** Maintain a military presence in the following province:  
  - Sardinia et Corsica

---

- **Objective:** Receive 500 in diplomatic tribute from the following faction:  
  - Berbers  
- **Description:**

---

#### Separatist Only: Meal or No Meal?

- **Objective:** Hold 4 settlements, including the following:  
  - Carthago (Current total: 4)  
- **Description:**  
  "After the Battle of Ad Decimum, Belisarius captured Carthage, sitting upon Gelimer's throne in the name of the Emperor. Yet, as he enjoyed the feast prepared for Gelimer in the sure certainty of the Vandal king's victory, he could have taken the throne for himself."

- **Objective:** Construct the following building:  
  - Garrison Encampment in Africa Proconsularis

---

#### Expedition Only: Networking

- **Objective:** Reclaim the following settlement:  
  - Carthago

---

#### Expedition Only: The Just Shall Live by Faith

### chapter-ii-the-stolen-throne

CHAPTER II: THE STOLEN THRONE
TROUBLE AT HOME

    Objective: Assassinate a character belonging to the following faction: Ostrogothic Kingdom

    Body: "Gothic inaction and dynastic dispute is what gave Justinian casus belli for invasion. Belisarius exploited this instability to make rapid gains. The shaky Gothic leadership were key; targeting them would further destabilise the kingdom."

    Reward: 1000

CHAPTER II: THE STOLEN THRONE
ONE HUNDRED & ONE DALMATIAS

    Objective: Maintain a military presence in each of the following provinces:

        Dalmatia

    Body: "Dalmatia was one of the Empire's first targets in its campaign to reclaim Italy; securing it would allow the straightforward passage of its armies into northern Italy, making the rest of the campaign run more smoothly. Yet fortune was fickle - initial victories were squandered, meaning Dalmatia had to be repeatedly recaptured, diverting Rome's military resources from their chief task."

    Reward: 1000
CHAPTER II: THE STOLEN THRONE
SEPARATIST ONLY: HEIR TO THE EMPIRE

    Objective: Hold 25 settlements, including the following:

        (Current total: 9)

        Roma

        Neapolis

    Body: "In December AD536, Belisarius entered Rome, the ancient capital and former centre of Imperial power. This symbolic victory may well have been all-consuming, and laid the groundwork for the restoration of a new, entirely separate Roman Empire."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER II: THE STOLEN THRONE
SEPARATIST ONLY: VANDALISED

    Objective: Spread your religion to the majority of this region:

        Carthago

    Body: "Vandal Africa was an embarrassment to Justinian, as the Vandals continued to concede the Empire's suzerainty over them. To this end, every trace of their culture and religion was removed, as if it had never been."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER II: THE STOLEN THRONE
EXPEDITION ONLY: RETURNING HOME

    Objective: Reclaim 30 different settlements including the following:

        (Current total: 9)

        Roma

        Neapolis

    Body: "In AD546 Belisarius finally reclaimed Rome, the eternal city, in the name of the Empire. Rome, ancient capital of the Republic, then seat of the Empire, had symbolic - far more than strategic - value."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER II: THE STOLEN THRONE
EXPEDITION ONLY: GOOD GRACES

    Objective: Ensure that your faction does not settle.

    Body: "Belisarius' campaigns of reconquest had so far been a trial, but triumphant. Justinian was pleased, and the general continued to enjoy the Emperor's good graces. Now, the rest of Italy was waiting his attentions, but Justinian was watching with interest his every move."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER III: AN EMPIRE ASCENDS
CHAPTER III: AN EMPIRE ASCENDS

    Objective: Survive until the following date: Spring 540

    Body: "The Empire ascends once more, and the darkening world once again seems bright. Yet Imperial lands are not entirely freed from their barbarous yolk, and so Rome must march against them."

    Reward: 2000

    CHAPTER III: AN EMPIRE ASCENDS
THE RIVALS

    Objective: Carry out 1 political actions including the following:

        (Current total: 2)

        Diminish Popularity

    Body: "Narses was a rival general who accompanied Belisarius on parts of his Italian campaign. Though talented, he disagreed with Belisarius on several occasions, leading revolts within the army's ranks and almost causing Rome's strategy to fail."

    Reward: 1000


CHAPTER III: AN EMPIRE ASCENDS
HOW HAVE THE MIGHTY FALLEN?

    Objective: Construct the 1 following buildings:

        Private Latrines

    Body: "Sometimes the whim of fate, cruel in its indifference, decides the fate of nations rather than man. The Franks under Theudebert came close to frustrating both Gothic and Imperial ambitions, but were struck down and near-wiped out by dysentery. However, some fates can be mitigated against..."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER III: AN EMPIRE ASCENDS
SEPARATIST ONLY: A FORK IN THE ROAD

    Objective: Be at war with the following faction: Roman Empire

    Body: "Belisarius was poised to seize total victory when he was recalled by Justinian which, in many ways, squandered his efforts. At the siege of Ravenna, the Goths offered him kingship rather than endure continued subservience to Justinian. What would have happened had he earnestly accepted the throne?"

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER III: AN EMPIRE ASCENDS
SEPARATIST ONLY: A CAPITAL IDEA

    Objective: Hold 20 settlements, including the following:

        (Current total: 26)

        Ravenna

    Body: "Although Rome was the original seat of Imperial power, Ravenna had been the government's home for years before the Western Empire fell, as it was well-placed to avoid being sacked by the marauding Huns. Naturally, any claimant to the Imperial throne would want to seize the old administrative hub for himself."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER III: AN EMPIRE ASCENDS
EXPEDITION ONLY: SEVER THE HEAD

    Objective: Reclaim 45 different settlements including the following:

        (Current total: 18)

        Ravenna

    Body: "Belisarius entered Ravenna in May AD540, finally subduing the Ostrogothic remnants who had previously offered to make him Emperor of a revitalised Western Rome. Belisarius feigned acceptance, then seized the city in the name of Justinian once he had arrived."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER III: AN EMPIRE ASCENDS
EXPEDITION ONLY: SLINGS & ARROWS

    Objective: Ensure that your faction does not settle.

    Body: "Justinian must have felt threatened by Belisarius as, no sooner had Ravenna been conquered, he was redeployed away from the Italian front. Yet Belisarius' loyalty to him, and to the Empire, never wavered."

    Reward: 1000
    CHAPTER IV: FALSE KINGS
CHAPTER IV: FALSE KINGS

    Objective: Survive until the following date: Spring 547

    Body: "Through strength and divine justice our world is returned to us - the Empire regained! Now it must be stalwart and resolute, unflinching against a tide of unworthy, would-be kings!"

    Reward: 2000
CHAPTER IV: FALSE KINGS
TAX-DEDUCTIBLE

    Objective: At the end of your turn, have an income of at least 10000 talents.

    (Income in previous turn: 28785)

    Body: "Although many of the Ostrogoths had been put to the sword, they resurged under Totila, quickly seizing control of much of the Italian countryside. His efforts disrupted the flow of income to the Empire, leaving them little funds with which to combat this renewed Gothic aggression."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER IV: FALSE KINGS
POWER PLAYS

    Objective: Give 1000 in diplomatic tribute to the following faction: Ostrogothic Kingdom

    Body: "Man is ever fickle, especially where power is concerned. So it was with the Goths, who attempted to appease Justinian on several occasions, whilst trying to placate other barbarian kingdoms at the same time. With better intelligence, Belisarius' could have used these fragile alliances to his advantage..."

    Reward: 1000

CHAPTER IV: FALSE KINGS
SEPARATIST ONLY: TRIBAL WAVE

    Objective: Ensure that the following factions have no military presence within your territory:

        Ostrogothic Kingdom

        Langobards

        Moors

        Vandalic Kingdom

    Body: "Holding the reclaimed Italian lands became a serious problem for Belisarius, as the determined Goths persisted in their attempts to retake their lost kingdom. For Rome's first general, constant vigilance and savvy strategy were required to hold back the tribal tide."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER IV: FALSE KINGS
SEPARATIST ONLY: THE HAND THAT FEEDS

    Objective: Be at war with the following faction: Roman Empire

    Body: "Had Belisarius marched into Ravenna and declared himself Western Emperor, then it is doubtless that war with his former masters would have been inevitable and immediate. In the long run, this war may have been protracted and bloody, but necessary."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER IV: FALSE KINGS
EXPEDITION ONLY: FINISH THE JOB

    Objective: Maintain 200 units in total.

        (Current total: 140)

    Body: "Following his redeployment to the east, Belisarius was sent back to Italy as the situation there deteriorated in his absence. However, he was unable to replicate his previous success, as Justinian's capricious jealousy saw to it that he was denied the manpower he required to secure total victory."

    Reward: 1000

    CHAPTER IV: FALSE KINGS
EXPEDITION ONLY: BELISARIUS THE RESOLUTE

    Objective: Ensure that your faction does not settle.

    Body: "Belisarius had, by this point of his career, been relegated by the Emperor, whose jealousy now saw rivals ascend beyond the former first general. All the same, his own loyalty sharpened Belisarius' focus, and he continued to fight for the Emperor."

    Reward: 1000
