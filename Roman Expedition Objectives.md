- **Reward:** 2000 gold

---

#### Objective: Godas' Gold

- **Objective:** Maintain a military presence in the following province:
  - Sardinia et Corsica
- **Description:** "Justinian saw opportunity for invasion when Gelimer's Vandal Kingdom showed signs of fracturing. The revolution of Godas in Sardinia gave him reason enough to dispatch an expedition to the region."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Objective: I Am the Law

- **Objective:** Receive 500 in diplomatic tribute from the following faction:
  - Berbers
- **Description:** "The Moors and Berbers surrounding the Vandal Kingdom were, at first, happy to recognise Justinian's authority over it. Therefore, Belisarius was able to exact tribute from them to prove their loyalty to the Emperor."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Separatist Only: Meal or No Meal?

- **Objective:** Hold 4 settlements, including the following:
  - Carthago (Current total: 4)
- **Description:** "After the Battle of Ad Decimum, Belisarius captured Carthage, sitting upon Gelimer's throne in the name of the Emperor. Yet, as he enjoyed the feast prepared for Gelimer in the sure certainty of the Vandal king's victory, he could have taken the throne for himself."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Separatist Only: Bar the Windows

- **Objective:** Construct the following building:
  - Garrison Encampment in Africa Proconsularis
- **Description:** "In the wake of Belisarius' victory at Ad Decimum, Carthage fell easily. However, the fear of a Vandal counterattack meant that fortifications were hastily strengthened, lest Belisarius immediately lost his hard-won prize."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Expedition Only: Networking

- **Objective:** Reclaim the following settlement:
  - Carthago
- **Description:** "Ad Decimum was the last serious Vandal attempt to resist Rome, Carthage capitulating soon after without putting up much of a fight. Subsequently, the population boasted of the city's strategic value, joyous at the return to Roman rule."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Expedition Only: The Just Shall Live by Faith

- **Objective:** Ensure that your faction does not settle.
- **Description:** "Belisarius' victory in Africa must have been a heady tonic – the temptation to claim the kingdom as his own must have been strong. Yet he knew that Justinian was watching, and loyalty to the Emperor stayed Belisarius' hand."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

### Chapter II: The Stolen Throne

#### Objective: Trouble At Home

- **Objective:** Assassinate a character belonging to the following faction: Ostrogothic Kingdom
- **Description:** "Gothic inaction and dynastic dispute is what gave Justinian casus belli for invasion. Belisarius exploited this instability to make rapid gains. The shaky Gothic leadership were key; targeting them would further destabilise the kingdom."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Objective: One Hundred & One Dalmatias

- **Objective:** Maintain a military presence in each of the following provinces:
  - Dalmatia
- **Description:** "Dalmatia was one of the Empire's first targets in its campaign to reclaim Italy; securing it would allow the straightforward passage of its armies into northern Italy, making the rest of the campaign run more smoothly. Yet fortune was fickle - initial victories were squandered, meaning Dalmatia had to be repeatedly recaptured, diverting Rome's military resources from their chief task."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Separatist Only: Heir to the Empire

- **Objective:** Hold 25 settlements, including the following:
  - Roma
  - Neapolis
  - (Current total: 9)
- **Description:** "In December AD536, Belisarius entered Rome, the ancient capital and former centre of Imperial power. This symbolic victory may well have been all-consuming, and laid the groundwork for the restoration of a new, entirely separate Roman Empire."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Separatist Only: Vandalised

- **Objective:** Spread your religion to the majority of this region:
  - Carthago
- **Description:** "Vandal Africa was an embarrassment to Justinian, as the Vandals continued to concede the Empire's suzerainty over them. To this end, every trace of their culture and religion was removed, as if it had never been."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Expedition Only: Returning Home

- **Objective:** Reclaim 30 different settlements including the following:
  - Roma
  - Neapolis
  - (Current total: 9)
- **Description:** "In AD546 Belisarius finally reclaimed Rome, the eternal city, in the name of the Empire. Rome, ancient capital of the Republic, then seat of the Empire, had symbolic - far more than strategic - value."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Expedition Only: Good Graces

- **Objective:** Ensure that your faction does not settle.
- **Description:** "Belisarius' campaigns of reconquest had so far been a trial, but triumphant. Justinian was pleased, and the general continued to enjoy the Emperor's good graces. Now, the rest of Italy was waiting his attentions, but Justinian was watching with interest his every move."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

### Chapter III: An Empire Ascends

#### Objective: An Empire Ascends

- **Objective:** Survive until the following date: Spring 540
- **Description:** "The Empire ascends once more, and the darkening world once again seems bright. Yet Imperial lands are not entirely freed from their barbarous yolk, and so Rome must march against them."
- **Reward:** 2000

---

#### Objective: The Rivals

- **Objective:** Carry out 1 political action including the following:
  - Diminish Popularity (Current total: 2)
- **Description:** "Narses was a rival general who accompanied Belisarius on parts of his Italian campaign. Though talented, he disagreed with Belisarius on several occasions, leading revolts within the army's ranks and almost causing Rome's strategy to fail."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Objective: How Have The Mighty Fallen?

- **Objective:** Construct the 1 following buildings:
  - Private Latrines
- **Description:** "Sometimes the whim of fate, cruel in its indifference, decides the fate of nations rather than man. The Franks under Theudebert came close to frustrating both Gothic and Imperial ambitions, but were struck down and near-wiped out by dysentery. However, some fates can be mitigated against..."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Separatist Only: A Fork in the Road

- **Objective:** Be at war with the following faction: Roman Empire
- **Description:** "Belisarius was poised to seize total victory when he was recalled by Justinian which, in many ways, squandered his efforts. At the siege of Ravenna, the Goths offered him kingship rather than endure continued subservience to Justinian. What would have happened had he earnestly accepted the throne?"
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Separatist Only: A Capital Idea

- **Objective:** Hold 20 settlements, including the following:
  - Ravenna (Current total: 26)
- **Description:** "Although Rome was the original seat of Imperial power, Ravenna had been the government's home for years before the Western Empire fell, as it was well-placed to avoid being sacked by the marauding Huns. Naturally, any claimant to the Imperial throne would want to seize the old administrative hub for himself."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Expedition Only: Sever the Head

- **Objective:** Reclaim 45 different settlements including the following:
  - Ravenna (Current total: 18)
- **Description:** "Belisarius entered Ravenna in May AD540, finally subduing the Ostrogothic remnants who had previously offered to make him Emperor of a revitalised Western Rome. Belisarius feigned acceptance, then seized the city in the name of Justinian once he had arrived."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Expedition Only: Slings & Arrows

- **Objective:** Ensure that your faction does not settle.
- **Description:** "Justinian must have felt threatened by Belisarius as, no sooner had Ravenna been conquered, he was redeployed away from the Italian front. Yet Belisarius' loyalty to him, and to the Empire, never wavered."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

### Chapter IV: False Kings

#### Objective: False Kings

- **Objective:** Survive until the following date: Spring 547
- **Description:** "Through strength and divine justice our world is returned to us - the Empire regained! Now it must be stalwart and resolute, unflinching against a tide of unworthy, would-be kings!"
- **Reward:** 2000

---

#### Objective: Tax-Deductible

- **Objective:** At the end of your turn, have an income of at least 10000 talents. (Income in previous turn: 28785)
- **Description:** "Although many of the Ostrogoths had been put to the sword, they resurged under Totila, quickly seizing control of much of the Italian countryside. His efforts disrupted the flow of income to the Empire, leaving them little funds with which to combat this renewed Gothic aggression."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Objective: Power Plays

- **Objective:** Give 1000 in diplomatic tribute to the following faction: Ostrogothic Kingdom
- **Description:** "Man is ever fickle, especially where power is concerned. So it was with the Goths, who attempted to appease Justinian on several occasions, whilst trying to placate other barbarian kingdoms at the same time. With better intelligence, Belisarius' could have used these fragile alliances to his advantage..."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Separatist Only: Tribal Wave

- **Objective:** Ensure that the following factions have no military presence within your territory:
  - Ostrogothic Kingdom
  - Langobards
  - Moors
  - Vandalic Kingdom
- **Description:** "Holding the reclaimed Italian lands became a serious problem for Belisarius, as the determined Goths persisted in their attempts to retake their lost kingdom. For Rome's first general, constant vigilance and savvy strategy were required to hold back the tribal tide."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Separatist Only: The Hand That Feeds

- **Objective:** Be at war with the following faction: Roman Empire
- **Description:** "Had Belisarius marched into Ravenna and declared himself Western Emperor, then it is doubtless that war with his former masters would have been inevitable and immediate. In the long run, this war may have been protracted and bloody, but necessary."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Expedition Only: Finish the Job

- **Objective:** Maintain 200 units in total. (Current total: 140)
- **Description:** "Following his redeployment to the east, Belisarius was sent back to Italy as the situation there deteriorated in his absence. However, he was unable to replicate his previous success, as Justinian's capricious jealousy saw to it that he was denied the manpower he required to secure total victory."
- **Reward:** 1000

---

#### Expedition Only: Belisarius the Resolute

- **Objective:** Ensure that your faction does not settle.
- **Description:** "Belisarius had, by this point of his career, been relegated by the Emperor, whose jealousy now saw rivals ascend beyond the former first general. All the same, his own loyalty sharpened Belisarius' focus, and he continued to fight for the Emperor."
- **Reward:** 1000
