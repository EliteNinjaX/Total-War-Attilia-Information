## 🏛️ Introduction

*The Last Roman* campaign allows you to play as Belisarius leading the **Roman Expedition** under Emperor Justinian I.  
The campaign features unique **Chapter objectives**, which guide the player through historical and alternate-history choices.

This document records a list of those objectives. I am not sure if there is anything after IV but by that point I had almost killed the whole map.

## 🎮 How Objectives Work

- Objectives unlock sequentially as you reach certain dates.
- At a certain point, players must choose to either:
    - Remain **loyal to Justinian** (loyalist path)
    - **Declare independence** and restore the Western Roman Empire (separatist path)
